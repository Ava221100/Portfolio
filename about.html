            <p>I for now am living at home with my two wonderful dogs Chunk and chata. I also have four dig cats; Garfield, Toothless, Minie, and Henry. I have in my oppinion the funniest dad ever. One of his many jokes is to say "Ava you'r an aspenpean." He says this for my mixed culture of deing Aision, Hispanic, and European. One of my most favoret colors is blue. I like sweats, spicey food and fruits.</p>
            

            <p>I am very family oriented, family means the world to me. I have a big family with six older siblings im the youngest. The house was prety full with all of us runing around having fun. Three of my older siblings are married and my big sister Airanna will be married too soon. I was also blesed with seven beautiful and amazing nephews all boys.</p>
